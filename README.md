# React Photo Manager App

This repository contains several pages, including UserDashboard, SignUp, and SingIn. I have created two dummy users for your convenience:

1. Email: user1@gmail.com, Password: 123456
2. Email: user2@gmail.com, Password: 123456

At the beginning, neither user has uploaded any images, so their default image counts are both zero.

## Usage

1. Log in with the first user and upload an image. You will receive the image URL in the console and in an alert dialogue box.
2. Copy the Image URL and paste it into the getImage input field after logging in as the second user.
3. When the image is visited, you will receive an alert saying "Visited successful."
4. Refresh the webpage of the first user, and you will see the count increased by One.
